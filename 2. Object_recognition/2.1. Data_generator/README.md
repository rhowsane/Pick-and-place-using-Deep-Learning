This directory contains the following tasks for each file/subdirectory:

## 1. Data: 
It contains 2 subdirectories (imgs_rot and labels_rot) which will receive 
the files generated in Blender. And the display_annot.py, where you can check if the 
bounding boxes are involving your objects correctly.
