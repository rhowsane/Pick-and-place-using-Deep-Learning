This directory has the following tasks for each file/subdirectory:

1. Data: will contain 2 subdirectories (imgs_rot and labels_rot) which will receive 
the files generated in Blender. And the display_annot.py, where you can check if the 
bounding boxes are involving your objects correctly.

2. Createtrain_test_path.py: will create the paths to the files generated by Blender
on your computer.

3. yolo_data_generator.blend: contains the objects in the environment on Blender, 
including the script for the data generator. The file ".blend1" was generated automatically
by Blender.
